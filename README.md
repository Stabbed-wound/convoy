# Convoy

Convoy is a board game I am creating as a rust library. It is a turn-based strategy game inspired by advance wars.

## Overview

Players spend money to buy units who take control of the board and capture towns to increase their income, which they

The infantry unit represents company sized detachment of troops. They require the support of a logistics system

command, able to act as both spear and shield throughout tactical engagements.

#### Recon

The recon unit represents a small mobile reconnaissance team. Their few numbers render them a non-threat to any notable
armed force but grants them the manoeuvrability to flee from a battle. They are the only unit capable of supplying
themselves, allowing them to infiltrate enemy controlled territory and sabotage critical logistics infrastructure. The
recon is a wildcard that can force you to mind your flanks and divert critical troops from the front-lines.
